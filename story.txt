I took a walk with my hund down to the local baeckerei. 
i picked out my favorite Gebaeck and shared it with my hund named robert. 
But Robert didn't want to eat it because he only likes apfelkuchen.  
So I took Robert down Hauptstrasse and jumped in my Porche BMW.  
We drove to the biergarten near the Schloss. 
There were a lot of people wearing lederhose and dirndels.
I was very surprised as the Schloss had no Klimaanlage so it must have been very hot for the people wearing the lederhose.
